# Hostel-Management-system
“Hostel management system” provides a detailed view of how the students records are maintained, how room allocation is done speedily and how students and manager both are facilitated. The hostel management system also equipped with some special features for helping hostel admin, like admin or manager can see all the details in one place without having to search it in manual file. Each record in the system has a unique identity, which identifies it in hundreds of records, and it can easily be searched by using a unique id. For designing the front end of the Hostel management system, we used HTML (hypertext markup language), CSS (cascading style sheet), JAVASCRIPT, jQuery and PHP and for backend we used SQL and XAMPP.
